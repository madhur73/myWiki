# Introduction

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online Gitbook hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/madhur73/myWiki).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, please take a look at how to use this wiki effectively and its purpose.



## Other things I wrote and shared

I share my knowledge in longer form by writing articles and making _Youtube videos._

I also love _writing code_ that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/madhur73)

## Make your own wiki

You can view other similar to this, continuously updated wikis, [here]().

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. Git Book provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

I'd love to hear any [ideas you have](https://github.com/madhur73/myWiki/issues/new) on how I can improve this wiki.

## Thank you

You can support me on GitHub or look at my projects.
