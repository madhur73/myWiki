# Corporate Finance

Throughout my education I was told that you need to  know your "Foundations" very clear. It took me long time to actually figure out What are these foundations? Do they really make any difference instead of learning the actual subject.

Well, when I was learning JavaScript I found a lot of its root to my "Programming Language course"  which helped me to grasp the new concepts easily. Further, after taking Foundations  courses of Computer Science like Operating Systems, Computer Networking, Databases, and many more , I was able to trace back the intuition of advance concepts in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision. So, in summary, fundamentals may not highlight skills on your resume but they sure will help you to understand advance techniques.

These course is taught by Prof. [Ashwath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm) at NYU Stern, one of the prominent professor at one of the best Business school in the world. These course is intersection of practical and Academics. 

Many Software Engineers are working in the Financial institutes where their work in very small part of large picture\(no offense\). But understanding the bigger picture of Corporate Finance could help them in their career and developing a new skills-- "How to spend your money?".
